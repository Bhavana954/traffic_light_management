# traffic_light_management
In current scenario one of the serious concern
for people in smart cities such as Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai,
Hyderabad etc. is traffic congestion. This has turned out to be
a daily problem in current time. Due to this road congestion
accidents in the city have raised to a great extent so lives
lost due to accidents are even more crucial. Due to this
congestion on the roads, emergency vehicles such as
ambulances, fire-cars and other vehicles cannot reach on time.
This results in huge loss of life. To tackle these issues up to a
great extent we present a solution in this project.  This can
save their time expansion for reaching the proposed
destination and can prevent the loss of human life up to great
extent. IoT provides a method to tackle these issues by
providing smart and intelligent traffic management system. 
In this project we use IR sensors to detect the density of
vehicles in each lane and based on the count signal is given to each lane.

# Setting up connections with Raspberry PI
we will connect components such as IR sensor, Traffic Light Led to the raspberry pi .Now we will connect the IR sensors and the Traffic Light LED with the Raspberry Pi according to the table:
